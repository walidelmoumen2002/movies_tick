<h1>Cinema Ticket Reservation Application</h1>
<p>This is a PHP-based application designed for managing and facilitating ticket reservations for a cinema. The application allows users to browse available movies, view showtimes, and reserve seats for their preferred shows.

The Cinema Ticket Reservation Application provides a user-friendly interface for customers to make reservations easily and quickly. It includes a search feature where users can search for specific movies or shows by title, genre, or date. Once they find the movie they want to watch, they can select the desired showtime and reserve seats for themselves or their group.

The application also includes an admin panel that allows cinema staff to manage movie schedules, seat availability, and customer reservations. Administrators can add new movies, update showtimes, and block off seats for maintenance or other purposes.</p>
